# mesh-pixel
Open source hardware/software for inconspicuous, wireless ir-mesh led pixels

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Please understand this is still in EARLY and UNPRIORITIZED development!!**


## üí° The Idea
- Single-pixel leds with independent addresses and an (APRS-like?) IR propagation/retransmission scheme utilizing tv-remote-style IR transmissions (which will work well at night)
- Tiny PCBs with black solder mask, easy to attach harmlessly to trees and structures
- Central control via a master station with an esp32, authenticated WiFi AP with web app and lightweight API
- Super low power consumption (power by button cell)
- Low-cost components, easy to assemble and deploy
